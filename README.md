## Responsive-Portfolio
Welcome to my page. 

In accordance with the requirement for this project, I created a Responsive Portfolio where I needed to develop three different files in html and customize them using advanced tools such as CSS and Bootstrap.

Finally, to conclude the task I validated the links in html and inspected them to confirm that they had the correct dimensions.
